# Inventory Management System

Inventory and asset management application built using MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js).  This application is a work in progress.  Over time it will develop into a full-scale inventory management and asset management application.  In the meantime, it will serve to demonstrate the latest techniques for developing robust single page web applications based around the MEAN stack.  It will also embrace continuous integration and testing workflows using Grunt, Karma, Protractor.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

#### Node JS

You will need Node.js.  If you don't have it installed already, you can find an installer for your operating system [here](http://nodejs.org "Get NodeJS"). The node installer will also install **npm**.  This project is currently using Node 0.10.26.

Once you have Node installed, clone the repo into a directory of your choice. Then run npm install from within the newly created project directory. This will download and install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

```
$ npm install
```
